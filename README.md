Official repository for my current portfolio - still under construction. I ultimately decided for my portfolio website to be simpler than my previous [iteration](https://github.com/kerekatu/personal-website-next-mdx), which has a functional MDX blog with many features, but the portfolio part of the website never got finished due to change of plan.

## Built Using

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
